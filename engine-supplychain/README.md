## Hyperledger Fabric & Composer "Engine Supplychain" example

This repository defines the source code for a Hyperledger Composer Business Network Definition. The network models a consortium of engine manufacturers and merchants which trace the production, sale and installation of car engines into cars of end customers.

## Branching strategy

Initial and final versions are stored in two separate branches to guide developers throw the process of developing a Business Network Definition for Composer.
This repository was created to demo the engine supplychain application [in a German article for Informatik Aktuell](https://www.informatik-aktuell.de/betrieb/virtualisierung/eine-blockchain-anwendung-mit-hyperledger-fabric-und-composer.html).


### Initial version (default branch)

In the branch `initial` you will find unfinished application skeleton. It can be started but contains no application code, yet. 

```
git checkout initial
```

### Final version

In the `master` branch you will find the final solution application. It contains implementations that fulfill a simple engine supplychain show case.

```
git checkout master
```

## Final functionality covered

There are different roles/personas: `Manufacturer`, `Merchant` and the interests of a `Customer` by tracing cars by unique legal identifiers of real cars.

1. As a `Manufacturer` I want to be able to create produced motors with a unique serial number in order to track further history of it and prove uniqueness.
2. As a `Manufacturer` I want to be able to transfer ownership of inserted motors to a `Merchant` in order to model a sell proccess to it.
3. As a `Merchant` I want to be able to transfer an owned motor to a `Customer` in order to model a sell process/installation process into his car.

## Further feature ideas

These are further ideas but did not have been implemented yet.

4. As a `Customer` I want to claim the two-year warranty by help of a `Merchant` at a `Manufacturer` in order to get a motors' damage repaired or refunded.
5. As a `Customer` or `Merchant` or `Manufacturer` I want to report a stolen motor in order to let everyone know that its serial number now resolves to a stolen item.

## How to use?

Pre-requisites:

1. Install [pre-requisites for Hyperledger Fabric](http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/prereqs.html)
2. Install [pre-requisites for Hyperledger Composer](https://hyperledger.github.io/composer/installing/installing-prereqs)
3. Install [Composer and its (dev) tools](https://hyperledger.github.io/composer/installing/development-tools)

The source code is implemented in JavaScript ES6 so it can make use of nice language features such as `async` and `await`, spread/destruct operators and so on.

Working with the repo:

1. Install dependencies and dev-dependencies: `npm install`
2. Run ESlint: `npm run lint`
3. Run unit tests: `npm test`
4. Compile this repository to a `.bna` file: `npm run createArchive`

For more information on Fabric and Composer and how to deploy `.bna` files to Fabric Networks, please read their development and operations documentation.
